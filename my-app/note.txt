Smart components : (handle API)
also known as container components, are responsible for managing state,
fetching data, and handling complex logic. 
They are often connected to a Redux store or other state management system and pass data and functionality down to their child components.
Smart components typically have more complex code and are often reused across multiple pages or sections of an application.

Dumb components: (Jest show UI elements)
also known as presentational or UI components, 
are responsible for rendering content and accepting user input. 
They receive data and functionality from their parent smart components and simply render that data in a specific way. 
Dumb components are often simple and reusable, and they typically do not have any knowledge of the application state or business logic.
